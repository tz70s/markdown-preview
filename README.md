# Markdown Previewer

This tool is an simple markdown file previewer inspired by hexo, and practice on web programming.

### Depedencies
I use the markdown transformer via [Blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) and [Bluemonday](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday)

### Usage
```Bash
# example
# ./markdown-preview [inputfile] [port(default = 9090)]
./markdown-preview README.md
# check out usage
./markdown-preview

```
