# Markdown Previewer

This tool is an simple markdown file previewer inspired by hexo, and practice on web programming.

### Depedencies
I use the markdown transformer via [Blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) and [Bluemonday](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday)

### Usage
```
#example
./markdown-preview 9090 README.md
```
